There are two modes - filebased and streambased. \n\n### Filebased\nWithin the filebased mode the buffer is dumped to an file and the Raspberry Pi Player APLAY is called in background with this file. This brings out best quality with minimum resources needed from the play.\nThe msg.speech should contain the WAV/OGG file (mybe directly from Text2Speach Service from Bluemix). This will be dumped into a file and after playing the temporary file it will be deleted. \n\n### Givenfile\nYou can also play own pregiven files by using msg.filename (like /path/filename.wav). The msg.choose has then set to \"givenfile\" and msg.filename to the name with path.\n\n### Streambased\nThe streambased mode is for streaming directly the buffer into a speaker framework (using node-speaker) which is from the quality perspective not very good. \n\n### speakerPi output node\n\nIf msg.speech as an input contains the WAV/OGG .\n\nThe node also needs a defined sound configuration which contains channels (1 or 2), the bitdepth (8 or 16) and the samplerate (11025, 22050 or 44100) set in the node or in the msg.speakerConfig for the sound in msg.speech. \n\n```\nspeakerConfig = { \n\tchannels: 1\n\tbitdepth: 16\n\tsamplerate: 22050\n\t }\n```",
